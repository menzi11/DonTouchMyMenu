# DonTouchMyMenu
A exe that stay in the taskbar, specifically for scan and deleting useless registry entries in the right-click menu.
I know I can dig into the regedit to manually delete all the keys, or set permissions for keys to let no app can change it. but if you think so, u are toooo naive. some app just refuse to be run if it can't change the keys. u have to give them the permissions the let them control ur right click menu.

There is no special reason to use Juce instead of Qt, just because I am familiar with Juce.

This project is still in its early stages and no one should use it. I will keep update it when I am not busy. Considering that I have been very busy all the time, no one should expect anything about this project. again, no one should use it.
